=head1 NAME

Quant::Framework::InterestRate - A module to save/load interest rates for currencies

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module saves/loads interest rate data to/from Chronicle.

 my $ir_data = Quant::Framework::InterestRate->new(symbol => 'USD',
        rates => { 7 => 0.5, 30 => 1.2, 90 => 2.4 });
 $ir_data->save;

To read interest rates for a currency:

 my $ir_data = Quant::MarketData::InterestRate->new(symbol => 'USD');

 my $rates = $ir_data->rates;
